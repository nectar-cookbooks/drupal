Overview
========

This cookbook contain recipes for configuring Drupal on NeCTAR virtuals.

The "default" recipe configures a core Drupal installation.


Status / Planned features
-------------------------

* I'm developing / testing using ubuntu 14.04.
* When the base recipes are working, next cab off the rank will be AAF 
  enablement.
* Then, maybe, see about generic support for Drupal "distributions", "modules"
  and "themes".
* Also, maybe, hooks for installing Drupal / PHP dev't tools.
